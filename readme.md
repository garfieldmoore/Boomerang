Boomerang is a framework for faking responses from external web services in acceptance/integration tests.  

This makes tests faster and less brittle, allowing you to get consistent and fast feedback from your tests.

The philosophy behind Boomerang is simplicity and extensibility.  Take a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/garfieldmoore/Boomerang/wiki) to see how to use and extend Boomerang.
