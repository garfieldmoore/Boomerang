Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Telerik hereby grants to Licensee and Licensee hereby accepts, a limited, non-transferable, perpetual, royalty-free, sublicenseable (solely as set forth in Section 1.4 Sublicensing), non-exclusive license (the "License") to use the Telerik computer software identified as FiddlerCore and any updates, upgrades, modifications and error corrections thereto provided to Licensee (the "Programs") and any accompanying documentation (the "Documentation", together with the Programs, collectively the "Software") solely as specified in this Agreement. You are granted either a Non-commercial License pursuant to Section 1.5 or a Developer License with Updates and Support pursuant to Section 1.6. Which version of the License applies (i.e., Non-commercial License or Developer License with Updates and Support) is determined at the time of the License purchase.

1.1.1 The included library BCMakeCert.dll is the C# version of "The Legion of the Bouncy Castle" http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/licence.html and its redistribution is governed by the terms specified by its owners. See http://www.bouncycastle.org/csharp/licence.html for details.

1.1.2 The included library MakeCert.exe is Microsoft's certificate generation library. This library is redistributed under the license terms included with Visual Studio 2008.

1.2 Scope of Use. The Software is licensed, not sold, on a per-seat basis. You may only allow the number of individuals in Your organization to use the Software that corresponds to the maximum number of License seats You have licensed from Telerik hereunder. This means that at any given time, the number of individuals authorized to use the Software under the License (each a "Licensed Developer") cannot exceed the number of seats licensed to You by Telerik pursuant to this Agreement. The Software is in "use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g. hard disk or other storage device) of that computer for development purposes. Your Licensed Developers may install the Software on multiple machines, so long as the Software is not being used simultaneously for development purposes at any given time by more Licensed Developers than You have License seats. You are not limited by the number of License seats with respect to how many individuals within Your organization may access and use the Software for testing and building purposes. You may also embed copies of the Programs in Your own proprietary software applications that You develop, license and distribute to Your own end-user licensees ("Authorized End-Users"), solely in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 1.4 below. 

1.3 Redistribution Rights. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, You are granted a limited license to redistribute the Software solely as part of bundled software solutions for internal company use, hosted applications, solutions deployed at Your Authorized End-Users sites, or shrink-wrapped software offerings in which the Software is integrated (collectively "Integrated Products"). "Integrated Products", as defined herein, are limited to those software solutions which: (i) are developed by Your Licensed Developer; (ii) add substantial functionality beyond the functionality provided by the incorporated components of the Software; and (iii) are not commercial alternatives for, or competitive in the marketplace with, any Telerik product offering, including but not limited to the Software or any components of the Software.

1.3.1 The foregoing license to redistribute the Software is conditioned upon the following: 

1.3.1.1 You must prohibit Your Authorized End-Users from using the Software independently from Your Integrated Products, or from decompiling, reverse engineering or otherwise seeking to discover the source code of the Software. For use of the Software in design-time (i.e. within a development environment such as Microsoft Visual Studio) Your Authorized End-Users need to purchase Developer Licenses from Telerik. 

1.3.1.2 You must include a valid copyright message in Your Integrated Products in a location viewable by Authorized End-Users (e.g. "About" box) that will serve to protect Telerik's copyright and other intellectual property rights in the Software.

1.4 Sublicensing. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, You are granted a limited, non-transferable right to sublicense the Software's use, in object code form only, solely to Your Authorized End-Users and solely in and as part of Your Integrated Products. In no event are You allowed to sublicense the Software or its use (a) in any format other than in object form, (b) as a standalone product, or (c) as a part of any product other than Your Integrated Product. Your end-user license agreement must: prohibit distribution of the Software by Your Authorized End Users; limit the liability of Your licensors or suppliers to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law; and prohibit any attempt to disassemble, decompile or "unlock", decode or otherwise reverse translate or engineer, or attempt in any manner to reconstruct or discover any source code or underlying algorithms of the Software. Provided Your Authorized End-Users are in compliance with their license agreements with You, any sublicenses to use the Software granted by You to Your Authorized End-Users will survive any termination of this Agreement or the License set forth herein between You and Telerik. You are not allowed to, and are expressly prohibited from granting Your Authorized End-Users any right to further sublicense the Software.

1.5.2 Restricted Scope of Use.  If You download the free Non-commercial License, the Software (i) may be used for development purposes by no more than five Licensed Developers and (ii) may only be embedded within Integrated Products that do not generate profit.  
1.5.2 Support. Your Non-commercial License does not include any support commitment.

6. Intellectual Property

All title and ownership rights in and to the Software (including but not limited to any images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, or text embedded in the Software), the intellectual property embodied in the Software, and any trademarks or service marks of Telerik that are used in connection with the Software are and shall at all times remain exclusively owned by Telerik and its licensors.

7. Limited Warranty

Except as specified in Section 1.5.4 (Non-commercial License), Telerik warrants solely that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90) days after the date on which You purchase the License for the Software. Telerik does not warrant the use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free at all times and in all circumstances, nor that program errors will be corrected. This limited warranty shall not apply to any error or failure resulting from (i) machine error, (ii) Licensee's failure to follow operating instructions, (iii) negligence or accident, or (iv) modifications to the Software by any person or entity other than Telerik. In the event of a breach of warranty, Licensee's sole and exclusive remedy and Telerik's sole and exclusive obligation, is repair of all or any portion of the Software. If such remedy fails of its essential purpose, Licensee's sole remedy and Telerik's maximum liability shall be a refund of the paid purchase price for the defective Software only. This limited warranty is only valid if Telerik receives written notice of breach of warranty no later than thirty (30) days after the warranty period expires. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 7, TELERIK DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Telerik be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the Software, including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if advised of the possibility thereof, and regardless of the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort or otherwise) upon which the claim is based. In any case, Telerik's entire liability under any provision of this agreement shall not exceed in the aggregate the sum of the license fees Licensee paid to Telerik for the Software giving rise to such damages, or in the case of a Non-commercial License, shall not exceed $5, notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not be applicable. Telerik is not responsible for any liability arising out of content provided by Licensee or a third party that is accessed through the Software and/or any material linked through such content. Any data and/or sample programs included in the Software upon shipment from Telerik is for testing use only and Telerik hereby disclaims any and all liability arising therefrom.

10. Confidentiality

Except as otherwise provided herein, each party expressly undertakes to retain in confidence all information and know-how transmitted or disclosed to the other that the disclosing party has identified as being proprietary and/or confidential or that, by the nature of the circumstances surrounding the disclosure, ought in good faith to be treated as proprietary and/or confidential, and expressly undertakes to make no use of such information and know-how except under the terms and during the existence of this Agreement. However, neither party shall have an obligation to maintain the confidentiality of information that: (i) it received rightfully from a third party without an obligation to maintain such information in confidence; (ii) the disclosing party has disclosed to a third party without any obligation to maintain such information in confidence; (iii) was known to the receiving party prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the confidential information of the disclosing party.

Each party's obligations under this Section 10 shall apply at all times during the term of this Agreement and for five (5) years following termination of this Agreement, provided, however, that obligations with respect to trade secrets shall be maintained as such until they fall into the public domain.

13. Entire Agreement

This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous communications regarding the subject matter hereof. Use of any purchase order or other Licensee document in connection herewith shall be for administrative convenience only and all terms and conditions stated therein shall be void and of no effect unless otherwise agreed to in writing by both parties.
